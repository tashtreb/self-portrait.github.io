		<!-- The above text displays both a <br /> and has this funny code: <br />   That funny code allows us to display the special characters that are typically used to define a tag so that we can display them without the browser actually thinking they are the start and end of a tag.  This symbol:  < is written as < meaning "less than".  This symbol: > is written as > -->
		This text will be a line down
		<br /><br /> <!-- Two line breaks --> <!-- Line break tags include the closing "/" as part of them, there isn't a </br> tag. -->
